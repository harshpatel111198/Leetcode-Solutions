Given the  `head`  of a singly linked list where elements are sorted in  **ascending order** , convert  *it to a*  ***height-balanced***   *binary search tree* .

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [-10,-3,0,5,9]
Output: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]
Explanation: One possible answer is [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the shown height balanced BST.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = []
Output: []

```

**Constraints:**

	
- The number of nodes in  `head`  is in the range  `[0, 2 * 104]` .
	
- `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
